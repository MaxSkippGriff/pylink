PsychoPy is a Python based stimulus presentation solution. 

It comes with native support for EyeLink eye trackers, and contains a fully featured wrapper for the EyeLink C API via the PyLink library. In order to use PyLink with PsychoPy the EyeLink Developers Kit must be installed on the same computer as PsychoPy.
